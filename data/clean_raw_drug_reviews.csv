0,jwillou,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 27, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),I have been taking Wegovy for 1 week and 2 days. Only had the .25 dosage. I have had no side effects and I have lost 8lbs. I am hoping as I increase the dosage I remain free of side effects and the weight continues to fall off. I will continue to leave feedback so people can see how it is working and hopefully it will help them make a decision. I almost didn't go through with the first injection because of all the negative reviews. I am glad that I did give it a try. If I start to get nasty side effects I will ask my doctor if I can stay at the dosage prior where there were none. I am wanting to loose 100lbs. I started at 250 @ 5'4,10.0,622,semaglutide,1
1,Slow...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 3, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),"Starting week 9 with the second injection of 1 mg. I have lost 24 pounds in 8 weeks. The side effects happen about 3 - 4 days a week. The first weekend on .25 mg was the worst! I really thought I needed my last rites! I have had headaches, nausea, vomiting, and bowel issues but not like the first-week episode. I try to eat light the day of the shot and take it at night because it makes me tired. You have to stay positive and just buy meds that will help with side effects because the side effects will probably always happen a couple of days a week. Try to drink 1/2 gallon of water a day and stay away from red meat, fried food, fast food, (most) dairy and sugar. If you don’t you will feel sick from eating that stuff. Also only eating one cup of food every couple of hours has made a huge difference in the nausea. Stock up on SF ice pops and SF Gatorade. I am so grateful that I got Wegovy with my insurance and when I want to quit I just remember how many people would love the opportunity.",,216,semaglutide,1
2,KS in...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 18, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),Tomorrow I will take my 3rd shot of .5mg (previously took 3 weeks of .25mg but messed up one of the needles so moved up after only 3 weeks at that amount). I have had very minimal side effects in the 5 weeks I've been on it (lost 9.5 pounds). The side effects I get are headaches if I don't drink enough water - WATER IS KEY -- and nausea if I don't eat enough protein. 5 small protein-based meals a day seem to do the trick. Have not suffered any of the other things people talk about. I've noticed my clothes are more loose fitting than a 9-pound weight loss would normally warrant. Everyone is different - and people tend to post complaints more than praises... so don't get too stressed assuming you'll have side effects. Most people don't. I'm glad I'm on this journey.,10.0,167,semaglutide,1
3,Smithy...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 14, 2023",Ozempic (semaglutide),"I was hesitant to try Ozempic for weight loss (need to lose 30 lbs) because I have a lot of kids/responsibilities and don't have the time to be nauseous or debilitating diarrhea, etc. After keeping the pen in the fridge for weeks, I decided to risk an injection and I'm so happy to say I've had zero side effects except a disinterest in food. I'm on week six of the .25 dose because its enough for me and I don't see a reason to increase the dose. My lack of interest in food is liberating! For the first time in 30 years I don't go to bed kicking myself for what I've eaten or making promises to myself to make amends for overeating. Zero sugar cravings...food isn't a reward or pleasure anymore. I'm never ravenous so I make good, calm choices about what I eat. This has been life changing and a complete shift in perspective. Obviously some people have terrible side effects, but I've had none (not even a headache!).",10.0,231,semaglutide,1
4,Philly,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 6, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"6 months. -65 pounds. Hypertension gone. Pre Diabetes gone. Sleep apnea gone. Lower leg skin breakdown gone. Slow progress now. I must fight return of old eating habits. Wegovy is not for wimps. But if you really want to lose weight, this is the way to go. This is like bariatric surgery in a small needle.",10.0,709,semaglutide,1
5,Lovew...,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"November 5, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I started at a size XXL/pants size 16 and 213lbs. After a little over a year, I am now 125lbs and a size small/pants size 2. This drug literally reset my entire body chemistry and metabolism. I never dieted nor exercised the past year. I don’t want to lose anymore weight, so I just went down to a 1mg half dose to maintain my weight loss. I am so grateful for this medicine!",10.0,356,semaglutide,1
6,KJF,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 19, 2021",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I am currently on my 9th injection today, being my 8th full week being on Wegovy. I have lost a total of 40 pounds so far. Appetite is definitely curbed. Sunday’s when I take the injection and it makes me tired. A lot of gas and the occasional runs, but the weight loss is worth the side effects.",9.0,609,semaglutide,1
7,Julie,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 20, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I've been on Wegovy for 3 weeks now. My biggest regret is that I let the negative reviews scare me from taking it for about 4 weeks. I finally decided to just do it and boy am I glad I did! This stuff is magic! It has completely curbed my appetite and I have had few side effects - mostly a metallic taste in my mouth, and increased thirst. Some very minor stomach upset but nothing that can't be dealt with. I have definitely lost weight but I'm not keeping track yet. I started with a 0.25 mg dose and will move to the 0.5 mg dose after the 4th week. If you're worried about side effects, just know that it's different for everyone and you won't know what your experience will be like until you try it.",10.0,127,semaglutide,1
8,LCMel,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 18, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"Wegovy has absolutely curbed my appetite at the .25 dose, I definitely do not feel nearly as hungry as I used to. I will eat maybe 1/3 to 1/2 of what used to be a normal portion for me and get signals to stop. It has not made me sick at all unlike other reviews. I think it's a real godsend for me with COVID and menopausal weight gain.",10.0,414,semaglutide,1
9,Jenni...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 1, 2023",Ozempic (semaglutide),"I started Ozempic on 2/22/23 weighing 216 lbs as of today 4/1/2023 I am 191.2 so just about 25 lbs in 5.5 weeks!! I started out at .25 for 4 weeks then moved to .5 last week. I've been nauseous maybe 4 times, I’ve gotten a few headaches and kinda backed up about 3 days a week. I started taking magnesium at night before bed and that really helped me get more regular. I’m barely hungry and need to force myself to eat. Anyways I’m really excited and I’m looking forward to summer!",10.0,110,semaglutide,1
10,Backt...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 9, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I started Wegovy 6 weeks ago at .25 mg for 4 weeks, and for the last 2 weeks at 1 mg. I started at 211 lbs and am now 197 lbs, so have lost 14 lbs and counting in 6 weeks. Not bad! Symptoms I've experienced include being slightly more tired than usual on the day of the injection, and some constipation at first but I use Miralax if there's an issue and it works fine for me. I haven't had any extreme nausea, but the injection definitely makes me less hungry and there are certain foods that I feel slightly queasy even considering eating--like high-fat foods--so I don't eat them. I eat a lot more fruits and vegetables and get full very quickly. I work out 4-5 days a week, my energy has been good and I feel like I'm getting back to my old self. I'd like to be about 135 lbs eventually. Wegovy has been a lifesaver. I'm 55 years old and had considerable cravings, especially at night. I'm happy to be free of them. I hope to make my new habits permanent.",10.0,129,semaglutide,1
11,Kmac,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"January 10, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"First of all, this does work. I lost over ten pounds in 6 weeks. The weight just fell off. Second of all, this was the worst experience I have ever had with a prescribed medication. Well, I started at the lowest dose and took that for 4 weeks before moving to the next dose which I believe was 0.5 mg. The maintenance dose is 2.4 mg I believe. How anyone makes it to the 2.4 mg is beyond me. I made it to the second dose of 0.5 mg before I threw in the towel. This stuff is WICKED. I spent 6 weeks of my life with an upset stomach, the absolute worst reflux and heartburn I have ever had, and constant nausea. I had to literally force myself to eat. Would not recommend. The side effects and the price is not worth it. Easy to lose weight when you are starving yourself and feel too sick to eat. Once I stopped it took a few days to feel better and the weight came back lightening quick plus a few. Not worth the misery in my opinion.",1.0,391,semaglutide,1
12,Wegovy...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"February 8, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I'm in my second week of the 2.4mg dose of Wegovy. A lot of folks who posted mentioned cramps and nausea. I would usually experience this the first day and second day of injections early on but not so much now in the 2.4gm dose. The cure for the nausea that worked best for me was a couple bouillon cubes. Did the trick every time. Ate high protein and low carbs. Increased salads which are a key component of doing well with Wegovy and a low carb/high protein diet. I had gastric bypass in 2011 and lost quite a bit of weight which I kept off for a while, but gained almost all of it back through Covid and began Wegovy in October, 2021. As of today I have lost 67 lbs which is absolutely amazing. I am rehabbing for a knee replacement and this has been the absolute missing piece. This has removed all cravings of food, alcohol and most other things. My dosing day is Tuesday mornings and I can really tell on Monday afternoon/night as I start to get those cravings! Make good choices!",10.0,324,semaglutide,1
13,Goodbye...,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 2, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I started ozempic last June. I switched to Wegovy in September. My start weight was 216.8 pounds at 5’6”, and I’m a 50 year old, post-menopausal woman. In 9 months, I’m down to 148.2 pounds (-68 lbs; almost 35%), and went from a size 16 to a size 8. Could only take 1.0 due to kidneys not functioning normally when upped to 1.7. I do not have time to work out. I thought it would be hard to give myself a shot, but it’s so easy! Absolutely amazing! Side effects are limited appetite and sleep (especially first couple days after shot), nausea (especially when brushing teeth or smell things), and hair loss (started more around month 6). But no other diet worked after menopause and stress for over 10 years. I love my new body (something I have NEVER said)! Will stay on it forever! Excited for warmer weather and outside activities (and the strength to do things)!",10.0,281,semaglutide,1
14,elish...,,"April 3, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),"Started on 0.25 mg. Had some side effects but not enough to stop taking it. Nausea, but not terrible, heartburn which was bad at times, pepto bismol sorted it out, (have some on hand). Curbed appetite, but noticed it starting to not be so effective when it was time to up the dose. I am now on 0.5 mg. The third week and I am on a new dose and there's a big change. I have heartburn most of the time, especially if I try to eat starchy carbs, (1 slice of bread). Nausea here and there, but since I took the third dose of .5 mg, I have absolutely zero appetite, I know I should eat, but 1 or 2 mouthfuls of food is enough for me. I lost 12 lbs in the first month and will weigh myself at the end of the second month. Conclusion: if you really can't stop eating, and your health is suffering, speak to your doctor about Wegovy. It's not a magic wand, but will definitely help you. Make sure you drink plenty of water throughout the day.",9.0,73,semaglutide,1
15,Respi...,Taken for less than 1 month,"February 9, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),This medication has been amazingly good. Wow It's only been 4 days but my thought process of always thinking about what I am going to have for my next meal. Always food shopping Always having cravings to eat Never feeling full. THAT'S ALL CHANGED!!!! I am eating half what I did. I am only eating when I am hungry and that is less frequent. This is not in my head I know there is a change. Thank you so much. Yes of coarse 4 days is not enough time. But I am hoping that the 12 hours of thinking about food stops. Each and everyone out there knows what I mean. We are constantly thinking about what we will have for our next meal. Food shopping Collecting recipes. Eating 2 or 3 portions of food Eating between meals. Having deserts etc. Next report will be after a couple of weeks,10.0,285,semaglutide,1
16,Tracey,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"September 20, 2021",Wegovy (semaglutide),I have been on Wegovy 2 months now and I'm down 17 lbs. I don’t exercise . Only thing I changed was stop drinking cokes and try eat a little better. I have found certain foods will make me nauseous. The medication pretty much tells me when I'm full if I try to push the amount I get sick to stomach. This medication works for me,10.0,317,semaglutide,1
17,Life...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 10, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),"So far, after 4 months, this has helped boost weight loss. At 57, I’ve been battling with the slowest metabolism on earth! It didn’t matter what I ate, when, how, how much, nothing. I started an exercise program that I promised myself I would stick with for a minimum of 2 months and I did it like an adult. Meaning I did t work out for 3 hours my first time. After 4 months, I’ve lost 50 lbs, again, I added exercise prior to starting Wegovy because I had both knees replaced. I will have nothing else replaced due to being overweight. I, personally, have had NO side effects except I’m not hungry at all. But this allows me to make better choices. Best of luck to all!",10.0,38,semaglutide,1
18,Jersey...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"May 10, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I am finishing my 8th week on Wegovy. I have lost 17.1 pounds and feel amazing. I was afraid to start because of the side effects, but so far have been lucky and haven't had them. The best thing about Wegovy is the fact that my mind is no longer full of obsessive thoughts about food. I have lost weight a million times, but this is the first time I am aware that I am NOT thinking about food all the time. I eat really reasonable portions of food and am satisfied. No desire for extra food or snacks. It is absolutely a miracle.",10.0,36,semaglutide,1
19,Sally,Taken for 1 to 2 years,"March 9, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"Wegovy & Ozempic (both are Semaglutide, but Wegovy is a higher dose) have been LIFE-CHANGING. It has turned off the 24/7 hunger switch in my brain. I feel “normal” around food for the first time in my life. I started with Ozempic Jan 2021 and switched to Wegovy Oct 2021 (now at full 2.4 mg dose). To date, I’ve lost 87 lbs! I have 50 lbs more to lose. I’ve had virtually zero side effects, just minor upset tummy the 1st week. I feel full/satisfied with much less food, I no longer think of food constantly, I respond dramatically less to food cues (seeing or smelling food), and I no longer get overwhelmed at restaurants/holidays because of all of the delicious food options. I’m in control. The only bummer is the price. My Wegovy coupon is about to run out and my Ins doesn’t cover it",10.0,212,semaglutide,1

However, after one injection on the lowest dose I am so beyond sick. Two days after my injection, I got a migraine followed by extreme vomiting for 4 days, chills, nausea, and a trip to the ER. This medication made me so unbelievably sick, it is like I've been poisoned. I have missed 4 days of work and am so weak. Living on Pedialyte and numerous nausea medications. Please be so careful.

23,Jackie,Taken for less than 1 month,"March 12, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),Worst medication ever. On the lowest dose I became deathly ill. I couldn't stop vomiting for a week. I could not walk because of extreme dizziness and I could barely see from blurry vision. It also gave me the worst migraine of my life and suicidal thoughts and depression. I only lost weight because I could not eat at all and couldn't keep liquids down so I was severely dehydrated. The side effects and long term effects are so severe that the minor weightloss you would have from this medication is not worth it.,1.0,59,semaglutide,1
24,Highly...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"April 18, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I was worried about side effects with this medication but I have not had any.

Within an hour, I had a bit of shooting pain in my left mid-back section. I was a bit concerned but didn't say anything to anyone about it as I figured it was just my body getting used to a new chemical. I'm now on day 3, and no pain anywhere, no nausea, and feeling pretty great. I am a little concerned about not understanding exactly what my caloric intake",8.0,48,semaglutide,2

I am down 34 pounds since starting and haven't been hungry. It has been the solution to a lifetime of weight struggles! I did have hair loss start in the fourth month and have added a multivitamin to help. My hunger was so low, I asked my doctor to take me back to the month three dosage. Hoping both the vitamin and decreased dose will help with hair loss... so far it isn't noticeable to anyone but me (and my family seeing the hair on the floor/in the shower!). Even if I have had to go 1-2 weeks between doses due to backorder, I find I am still losing weight and my lack of hunger is the same. I occasionally eat",10.0,207,semaglutide,2
27,Mom...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"December 29, 2021",Wegovy (semaglutide),Just took my last injection of month 5 1.7. I have lost about 25-30lbs along with 3-5 days a week at the gym. Definitely curbs your appetite. The nausea is very real! Each month I thought it would get easier. It’s never does. A couple times I puked for hours. Lots of belching. In the beginning a little constipation. The first day or 2 after the injection you can feel fatigue. It works for weight loss if you can tolerate the nausea. This will be my last month. I have a 6 month prescription but I can’t deal with the nausea anymore.,8.0,193,semaglutide,2

I stopped it on October 8, 2021 because I was seeing extreme hair loss. I had called and spoke to a Wegovy rep the month before about it and they said someone was going to call me, as this was not a side effect that they knew of. No one ever called. I did look on another site and it did show hair loss. Know that hair loss with this product is real. It has been a very depressing time for me as they way I look at myself has changed because of the loss of my hair. HAIR LOSS IS REAL WITH WEGOVY",,182,semaglutide,2

30,Serena...,Taken for 1 to 6 months,"March 1, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"Seven weeks in and it’s great! I’ve lost 12 lbs already. I don’t have that many side effects to discuss, but you do have to be careful what you eat and how much you eat. If you try to eat too much food that is high in fat or high in sugar you will not feel well. You do have to listen to your stomach as you get full very quickly, if you push it you could become queasy. As long as I pay attention to this, I feel fine and have little side effects. I do inject it in my thigh as I have read that it reduces bad side effects. Perhaps that’s the key.",10.0,147,semaglutide,2

I am more than pleased that my cholesterol is now 180 from 270 on medication. I have never been below 200 total cholesterol in my life! I have had no symptoms taking Ozempic except little indigestion the first month. It is very convenient to use (inject once a week), and the needle is so thin (less than a hair) you don’t even feel it.

34,Bo Peep,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"February 28, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I started with Ozempic (which is the same thing, I think) for assistance with diabetes. In the first year, I lost fifty pounds, I became more capable of moving better, and I started. In February and March of the second year, I was hospitalized twice for massive blood clots in my right thigh and the Wegovy was put aside for a couple of months. In April of 2021, my endocrinologist asked me if I would like to switch to this new version that might give me a boost. Sure, why not. I started with the lowest and immediately moved to the 2.4 doses. I have had no side effects no problems with the injection sites. The only issue has been obtaining the medicine. Oh, health changes. Within the first year of the Ozempic, my A1c went from 8.1 to 7.3, in the second year it has dropped to 6.1. My blood glucose averages are about 130, I can live with that! I have to be careful with going too low! Total weight loss is hovering between 95 and 100 lbs.",9.0,134,semaglutide,2

I started this medication because at age 47 even though I tried so hard to exercise and diet my weight was a roller coaster ride and I would bounce back to my heaviest weight. My weight when I started was 170 lbs which was 3 weeks ago. After a week I am down to 159 lbs, then second week 157 lbs, I weigh myself yesterday and I am down 155 lbs that's 15 lbs less. The first week I had a little heartburn, and the second week was a little dizzy because you can go a day without being hungry at all. End of the second week I had no side effects at all. I am surprised that again I can go a day without being hungry at all but of course, I force myself to eat something even with food I will eat but will be so full easily. I take protein shakes daily as my meal replacement. I'm taking fiber (gummies) so I can go to the bathroom with no problem and it helps a lot. Overall I am pretty happy with the result.",8.0,7,semaglutide,2
36,WagOn,Taken for less than 1 month,"April 5, 2023",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I took my first shot of .25 5 days ago. I was extremely nervous about taking it due to all of the negative side effects that I read others have had. I decided to inject in my upper thigh late on a Friday afternoon, so that if I did feel sick I had the weekend to take it easy and deal with it. The injection was painless and very easy to administer myself. I honestly noticed no side effects after taking it, other than not thinking about food as much and wanting to eat a little less. I did push the boundaries on the third evening after taking it and I did have bad nausea (I actually vomited) and felt generally ill for about 16 hours (not bad enough to not work though). I pushed the boundaries by over eating air fried chicken wings (no sauce) that were a bit more greasy/oily than normal. Those really set me off and I realized that I: 1. can no longer eat any type of greasy food and 2. cannot eat too much. As long as I stick to my normal healthy, low carb diet, I feel just fine (so far).",9.0,32,semaglutide,2

My doctor prescribed me Ozempic 0.25 mg, and I was very worried about the side effects. However, I started it recently anyway and injected it in the upper thigh once weekly. I had no issues other than constipation, which I overcame with laxatives and increased water intake. My appetite was reduced by 90%. I used to overeat, but now I can only manage two small meals a day. It's really working so far, but it's still early days. I'm in Ireland, and it costs €150 a month for four injections, which are covered by my medical card.

Also did not drop a single pound. There were days I only consumed 600 calories and still felt awful. I read another review very similar and agree that you absolutely cannot eat anything spicy. Bland food days were better but there are not enough antacids and constipation meds in the world to make me want to lose 20 pounds this badly.

No matter what I did (including exercise and diet) nothing worked to diminish the belly fat. I started taking Ozempic at .25mg/week for 4 injections. I lost 15 pounds on that starter dosage. I increased to .5mg the following month and lost another 15 pounds. I will begin the 1mg dose this weekend for the next month. The Ozempic seemed to target that subcutaneous belly fat which is where I had the greatest weight loss. Except for a mild headache after the first dose and subsequent constipation, there were no other side effects. I took something to relieve constipation. My stomach is now almost as flat as a board and I don’t look pregnant. I know carrying all that excess subcutaneous fat is very dangerous and Ozempic melted that fat away. I would recommend keeping yourself very well hydrated and asking your doctor for a prescription to address the constipation. Truly amazing!",10.0,24,semaglutide,2

I don’t crave junk food and only eat 1/3 of what I used to since I stay full longer. It’s nice lol,8.0,4,semaglutide,4

I am very glad I didn't try to work otherwise I would have lost my job or at the very least been written up for various reasons. On it for a month. I tried spacing out the second shot and never ended up taking the last injection. Side effects: Severe fatigue, severe hair loss, decreased hormones, severe headaches, changes in your sleep architecture, bad nightmares for all sleep, naps, and overnight. Warning if you have PTSD that may mess with you. Bladder urgency and uti symptoms started on day 3 and were constant the whole time on the med, had to take AZO. Bloating, burping, throwing up, and all food smells make you sick, severe constipation, hypoglycemia, and increased binge eating. I also had increased topical psoriasis and arthritis pain. Started having problems with my foot and wondering if impacting ligaments. I am getting that checked out. Did not reduce the need to eat, no weight loss.",1.0,14,semaglutide,4
82,Anonymous,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"May 8, 2023",Ozempic (semaglutide),"I was prescribed Ozempic for weight loss in Nov 2022. I started on .25 mg for one month. I found it slightly suppressed my appetite and the side effects I had were awful heartburn, constipation, and sulphur burps. Sometimes I felt nauseous. I decided to stick with it anyway and increased to .5 mg after one month. The symptoms were the same but add in fatigue. A month later I bumped up to .75 and the burps, fatigue and heartburn subsided. I went to 1 mg 2 months later and all symptoms disappeared. I started at 192 lbs Nov 15th and as of May 1st I weigh 152 lbs. I found my sugar cravings disappeared once I started taking 1 mg. Up until then I still craved sugary foods. I lost all interest in greasy food ( fries, anything deep fried etc) from .5 mg and up. I personally love Ozempic. The side effects at the beginning were worth it for me but from the sounds of it, mine weren’t that bad. I have never once thrown up.",10.0,9,semaglutide,4

I didn't take my third dose on June 6 and don't plan to ever again, despite my doctor telling me to take a two-week break and retry it. He says the side effects are typically more tolerable after a two-week break, but I'm not willing to chance it. Since day one, my symptoms have been extreme fatigue, making it impossible for me to function in daily life. I can't do my job and I'm hardly able to be there for my kids without pushing myself as if my life depended on it. I've been missing out on everything for over three weeks because all I can do is go from bed to couch.

So my 5th injection. I’ve lost 6 pounds since I first started. My biggest issue is diarrhea and nausea. I get occasional stomach cramping. Otherwise, I too have noticed that drinking more water seems to help. Lots of saltine crackers for me. The first week I was scared to eat. I felt like I had the flu. It wasn’t a good experience for me. Then, gradually it let up and by that first Friday, I felt like myself again, but still ate with caution. I have no taste!! It’s odd. I know I’m eating but it’s like I’ve lost my sense of taste. I will update after these 2 boxes are complete and hopefully will have a total weight loss that’s up to date.

87,Black...,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"August 13, 2022",Wegovy (semaglutide),"I started Wegovy Jan. 2022. I didn’t feel much effect for two months, although I lost a few pounds. Starting the third month it kicked in. The weight loss isn’t fast, about 4 to 6 lbs a month, which I feel is healthy. I’ve lost 27 pounds. Like others, I had some queasiness especially in the first few months, but it was quickly resolved with Zofran and has mostly disappeared. I now feel full after smaller portions than before and notice I eat about half as much as previously and feel perfectly satisfied. I’ve read that you tend to gain weight back if you go off the drug and that many doctors feel you should be on it forever, as with other chronic conditions. I hope that’s not the case, as I don’t like the idea of being on any drug forever. In fact I’m hoping I can also go off blood pressure meds eventually. My goal is to lose another 30 lbs which now feels entirely do-able. My excellent insurance covers it at $25 a month.",9.0,38,semaglutide,4

I can feel it what it's suppose to do. I don't have much an appetite and I feel fuller faster and longer. I have been a yo-yo dieter. I tried a few weight loss programs and lost 50 lbs but I ended up gaining it back. I think this going to help me a lot and keep off the weight.

I had two days of extreme headaches after my first dose but I’ve only had mild headaches with dosage increases since. My stomach is mild to moderately upset most of the time, and most of the time I don’t have much appetite.

After I did this the nausea went away. I honestly keep thinking there is no way I can lose that kind of weight in one week and have been worried that it is mostly water weight and it still may be. The best thing about being on this medication is that I do not worry like I did on other diets. Meaning, I do not count calories, worry about eating differently from my family, and begrudging myself foods. What it has done is to force me to give up bad habits because I do not like staying nauseous.

No result nausea and a few bouts of the runs. However I had gastric bypass a few years back and my stomach is always off with dumping syndrome. In 18 days I’ve lost only 4.5 lbs and that is tracking macros and eating about 600 calories per day and keeping carbs under 80g. It definitely has taken my urge to eat away and have to force myself to eat. I don’t have intense fullness as I believe due to my stomach size I already eat tiny meals like 4 ounces so not pushing my stomach and having the medicine cause me to be sick.

Over the pandemic, my weight crept up 20 pounds and I am NOT going back up there. I've injected in my thigh and abdomen with no noticeable difference in efficacy. That said, constipation has been the new normal since my surgery so I wouldn't notice it as a side effect of Wegovy. If you're reading this and your insurance covers it, I would recommend it. You may have some mild side effects or even be one of the minority who have intolerable side effects and need to stop the medication -- but I think the odds of it working well, without making you miserable, make it worth a shot.

I had no appetite and felt very few side effects. I lost 10 -12 pounds in the first month. The 5th shot was .5 mg. I became so ill. It started with huge belches and nausea. That night I vomited and was so lethargic and nauseous that I didn't get out of bed for 3 days. I had weird sores on my tongue. The next day I vomited again. I had to get Zofran for the nausea which helped a bit. Almost a week later I am due for this week's shot and I have decided not to continue.

Only had a couple of incidences of terrible nausea, usually when I ate greasy, heavy, or fried foods. But generally, I feel like crap every day. Once on the Wegovy the weight literally fell off. Mostly because I just didn't think about eating anything, or my appetite would be satisfied with a very small portion of food. The biggest side effect is skin irritation; like a constant sunburn. Clothes touching my skin bother me. Or riding in a car and bouncing. It became intolerable. And chills, makes my skin ache.

Use it to shed some weight quickly and then.... Do what you must ultimately do: watch what you eat. Walk daily. Sleep well. Don't stress and that weight will never ever come back.

I took the homeopathic medicine Nux vomica 200C as needed (dissolve a pellet in 1/2 cup water and take a small sip, letting it rest under the tongue, stirring 10 times before each dose) and the nausea was much better. Better than taking another drug. I had read that these effects are smaller if you inject into the thigh, so I did that next dose at night and took the Nux vomica before bed. I have had almost zero nausea this week. I have lost 6.5 lbs so far, although I have had some hunger this week. I eat very cleanly – low fat, low carb, protein, and vegetables at each meal.

No side effects whatsoever but saying that I was (and still am) eating healthy (no greasy/fried food, no sugar, no alcohol, low fat). It curbed my appetite from the moment I took the 1st dose. I didn’t feel any hunger despite being on a low-calorie diet and exercising five times a week. 172cm tall and 64kg - my aim is to go back to 56kg. I stopped taking it because I hit 60kg after 10 days and felt I could drop the remaining 4kg by staying on a healthy diet and exercising. One day I had 2 cakes and chocolate- woke up the next day feeling rough so that was the end of sugary food too. Ozempic helped me cure my sugar addiction and greediness.

I am on the 2 week of the next dosage. Loss seems slower so I am adding exercise. I did not exercise the first month. I did mess up my first injection and wasted a pen. So I really only used 3 pens the first month. Now it is super easy. I really only felt nauseous once or twice. It passed quickly without other medicine. I can’t eat a full meal any more and I have increased my water intake. I am happy so far and can’t wait to see how much more I lose by the top dose. ( about 3 months ) I am 60 with arthritis in my hips and knees and I'm only 5’3”. The 14lbs that I have lost seems to have helped my hips a little. Hopefully more loss will help knees.

I felt sick for pretty much for 2 months and almost gave up several times, but since the weight was coming off and my husband was doing it with me, I decided to keep going and took Zofran for nausea. My side effects: exhaustion, diarrhea, nausea, gas cramps, and light-headed. Sometimes I still feel those things, but my body has adjusted mostly to it. In the beginning, I didn't feel like eating, and nothing sounded good. Now, I am hungry but can control my snacking. I lost weight quickly - 35 pounds. I had to keep buying new clothes. I do not want to lose anymore weight, since I reached my goal weight. Now, I take 30 units weekly to maintain the results. My cholesterol is the best it's been in years! I do work out 3 days a week, but I always have. I just couldn't lose any weight and ate too many snacks at night. This prevents snacking. Be careful not to lose weight too fast.

I have gone to the ER three times over 6 months with severe headaches but nothing helps. It has really impacted my way of life and I do feel like a worse wife and mother because I am always sick and a constant headache that never ever goes away.

I began with 0.25mg once weekly week one, increased to 0.5mg week two, at that point I began to experience intermittent nausea. This was bearable and I was still able to maintain my calories. I was down 8 lbs the beginning of week three. Week Three I increased to 0.75mg and had a LOT of fatigue. I felt like I was a walking zombie for 3 days. I realized at that time that I was not eating enough calories and made a continuous effort to meet my protein goal and the fatigue went away. I have now been on the medication for 9 weeks. I have kept the dose at 0.75mg (the suggested max dose is 2.5mg) and I am losing 2-3lbs a week. I feel great and all the side effects have subsided. I am reading that they peak and subside around 4 weeks. The initial titration period can be rough, but this was so worth it for me as I had weight loss resistance for years.

At 3 1/2 months, I had terrible stomach pains that sent me to the hospital. My liver was out of whack. They took me off Ozempic and Atorvastatin. Later I learned from the doctor and internet research that Ozempic does not affect the liver, but Atorvastatin can do that. Even so, I didn't restart the Ozempic but have lost another 40 lbs so far and my A1C is 5.4. I feel that Ozempic allowed me to retrain my eating habits and I hope to continue this way.

With the help of Saxenda I lost 50 pounds my first year. I started at 180 lbs and ended at 130 lbs. 10 more to go. This drug is only a tool. It isn't a miracle drug. If you continue to eat junk food and carbs, you will never lose weight. It is important to maintain a healthy meal plan and Saxenda will help with the cravings and assist in not overeating. It is also important to exercise as well. I found constipation to be an issue, but using Metamucil or a stool softener (not a laxative - as your body can become dependent upon laxatives), probiotic, and insoluable fibrous vegetables such as spinach, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes and celery can help with this. I also experienced some nausea at first, but this too will pass as your body becomes accustomed to the medication. Saxenda has been a wonderful life changing tool for me.",9.0,269,liraglutide,1

I've been diligently working on my nutrition for a long while so a low cal diet has not been my issue; weight plateau and emotional eating has been my problem. My doctor gave me a thorough description of how the med works so I had a good understanding going in, plus my sister had gastric sleeve surgery and this drug seems like it works like a sleeve or band surgery, without the surgery.

During the increased dosage phase I had mild nausea for the first day or so, then very little side effects. I struggle to consume more than 1000 calories/day while on Saxenda. As time has passed side effects are coming to light: low Vitamin B12/low energy, general fatigue, light headedness and irritation at the injection site (although that comes and goes). However I believe these are from a significant decrease in caloric intake, not the medication itself. I have started taking a high quality multivitamin so hopefully that will remedy some of these issues. My weight loss each week is directly linked with how much water I take in. Low water weeks = low weight loss weeks. 3+ litres each day and I lose at least 1kg a week.

Today same thing only I only could eat 180 cals then had energy to work out for 2 hours straight and tread mill (its been a long time since I've used my home gym) I haven't eaten again today and since I burned 160 cals doing that I technically ate 20 cals today!!! I'm usually a 3000 - 5000 cal a day person. Plus I drink wine every day and Saxenda it took away that craving as well. I'm down 5 lbs in 3 days, this is crazy awesome, zero side effects also. I'm praying it lasts. I'm on 0.6 for the dose and not going to increase at all unless I start getting hungry.

Two days ago I started working up to 1.8 by advancing the clicks a bit more towards 1.8 each day. Tomorrow will be on full 1.8. For me it seems that gradually going up to the required dose has really minimized the side effects. I am eating about 1000 cals a day and not hungry at all. I do light gym 3 times a week , more for a shoulder injury than cardio at the moment. NO alcohol except for the odd Vodka soda when socializing.

Side effects were minimal, I had some heartburn and constipation but nothing else. Lost approx 7lbs in conjunction with a 2000 Kcal p/d diet. However, was unable to lose any more weight despite consistently being in a calorie deficit. Also discovered that Saxenda really didn't help very much with hunger/cravings as it was supposed to, I haven't binged whilst on it, but remained constantly hungry.

My appetite came back for sweets and I have gained 25 lbs back. I decided to quit taking Saxenda, because it really wasn't helping me anymore, and my hunger pains are so bad now in comparison to before I started Saxenda. It's like my body has to get used to not taking it again. I've decided to try once again to try and lose the weight on my own by making better food choices. I want to stop this weight gain in it's track as I don't want to gain all of it back again. I just couldn't see myself taking this drug long term, especially since it quite working for me. Others may take it long term and it still works, but for me, after a year, all the cravings came back, as well as my appetite. I look for instances of people having the withdraws from it, but nothing is out there. Anyone quite taking it and feel EXTREMELY hungry?",7.0,68,liraglutide,5

Got all the side effects; headaches, dizzy, nausea, heartburn, no energy, irritable & bad stomach pains. But I stuck it out. The smaller doses didn’t stop my cravings, I was still hungry so I ate small healthy snacks & smaller meals. As doses increased side effects got worse & constipation set in. I’ve been losing approx 5 lbs per month, but I’m ok with my slow progress. Side effects got better except for heartburn & constipation. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and was given 1 year to turn it around. As of last week I am no longer diabetic. Today is Feb. 16, 2021 and I am currently 180lbs. I’ve lost 2 clothing sizes. I give my self small goals to keep my self motivated. There are days I don’t want to even look at food and some days that I still get cravings.

I can't believe that I don't feel hungry and realize now how much I was overeating. No side effects but I'm anxious about increasing the dose. I'm a nurse so I'm thinking of splitting the higher doses and taking it morning and evening to see if that will ease any nausea. Not sure if it will work but I'm going to give it a try.

Each time I increased the dose I felt a bit nauseous for a couple of days - like mild morning sickness. I truly ate whatever I wanted - but the fact was I didn't WANT anything. I had half size portions at family meals, the thought of fried, fatty or sugary food made me feel gross, and I even cut down to almost no alcohol. The biggest challenge was constipation initially.

Day 2 I wanted nothing to do with food, which was odd as food is my go to for comfort and enjoyment. I also found through my lack of desire to eat that food was a time filler for me, something to fill boredom. It came to dinner and the food smelt delicious, and because of my history I thought I would be able to ove ride the medication and eat as normal, however the desire was not completely there. If I am being honest the habit was there, but because the desire was not it took very little will power to overcome the eating for the sake of eating (I feel that is very important). The side effects: I feel very vague, headaches, nausea, neck hurts a lot and lots of cramps, but nothing unbearable.

I have experienced a lot of fatigue but my body isn't getting the sugar rushes and carbs that it's used to so I will accept that is a side effect for now, my body needs time to adjust. The nausea was helped with ginger tea but for me it was minimal. Constipation can be helped with movicol or dulcolax, (I needed it by day 4 but beware, as your digestive transit is slower add another 6 hours to the time you think the laxatives should work!)

Just sipping water or thinking about food caused me to vomit violently, I mean; I wouldn't be surprised if my boots flew out my mouth. First two days was a struggle just to stay hydrated. Day three I started to feel ok. I had to struggle to eat a bowl of soup. By day 7 I could eat a bowl of soup and some toast. Due to the side effects, I stayed on 0.6 for a fortnight before moving up to 1.2mg. Now I'm on the full 3.0mg dose with no side effects at all. I am satisfied with a bowl of cereal for breakfast, one sandwich for lunch and 170g steak and a small amount of vegies for dinner would be a feast. Losing 2kg/5lbs per week.

Now that number doesn't sound too encouraging for some, considering the time it took to get there. But, can you imagine how much more I'll lose once I'm up and active again? People tell me I'm the only person they know who can lay around and do NOTHING for over a year and still lose weight! I'm starting some aquasize classes this week. This will be the only form of physical activity I've had for almost 16 very long months! I'm so excited to see how soon I can take off my last 31lbs. To be continued............

I am consuming about 800 - 1000 calories a day and am seeing good results. I have lost 13lbs in 3 weeks and have started to workout. I have had no side effects to date. I take my saxenda at night, so if there are side effects, I can be sleeping through them. I am not hungry and when I eat, I get very full fast.

Was drinking pop, not eating slowly, lots of carbs, etc. I have gone back to eating how I ate after surgery. My doctor told me to eat 1100 calories and now I have problems getting 700 calories a day. I eat dense protein and drink decaffeinated tea. I am down 18 lbs. I am up to 2.4ml a day. Only side effects have been headaches this week, not sure if it is the medicine or not, could be the weather. If I eat quickly or eat junk, then I feel nauseated so I stay away from them. As long as I am eating high protein, I am not hungry. I have not started exercising and am fatigued but I know it is because I am not eating a lot. Probably need to supplement with 1 or 2 protein shakes a day to get a little more energy. I am very pleased with the help this medication is giving me.

I started this with low expectations but it has been amazing. You will have no appetite, but will have nausea and headaches at first. This is your body’s way of telling you it needs fuel. Try eating small stuff during the day. You basically have to force yourself to eat something. I found eating about every 3-4 hours (almonds, fruits, yogurt) will stop the nausea and headaches. Drink plenty of water because you will get dehydrated. I had HORRIBLE sulfur burps and heartburn for a couple of days. Nothing a little Pepto couldn’t cure. I’m on the 2.4 dosage and have lost 15lbs in one month. I’m going to try to start walking more once the weather permits. I started at 238lb. My goal is to be under 200",9.0,58,liraglutide,7

I am not the best example to learn from. My weight loss was strictly from the effects of Victoza curbing my appetite.

I took the injection later in the evening because I needed my mom to show me how (she’s a nurse). I hadn’t had dinner yet and after the shot, my stomach was growling non stop, so I just ate a sandwich and some Mac salad. Three hours later I became increasingly nauseous, then at around 2 am, I ran to the bathroom and vomited until there was nothing left, and then some. The entirety of the next day, Thursday, was spent either in bed or on my bathroom floor next to the toilet. The nausea was horrible! I didn’t eat the whole day and could barely stomach water. I didn’t take the injection again until today because I was busy and, quite frankly, afraid to feel like that again. The only time I’ve ever been that sick was when I had the flu as a child.

561,cares,,"October 15, 2019",Saxenda (liraglutide),I started Saxenda injections 6 weeks ago. I started at 0.6mg and up to 1.8mg and holding at this amount because I can't tolerate the side effects. I felt bloated at first and some sudden sickness the first week. I lost 10 lbs exactly after only 6 weeks and no exercise because of chronic illness. I have blood pressure issues and prediabetic with high HBA1C. I wish I knew there was a coupon on their website but my insurance covers the whole cost of this. I missed one dose and ate everything in sight. This takes away the cravings and can't believe I'm less than 200lbs that I've been stuck at for so long. So the meds will last me longer since I don't take the whole dose as recommended. It hurts at the injection site afterward but only briefly. No diet pill ever helped. I hope I don't need this med forever but my Dr. said I may have to use it to keep my weight down or change my portion habits. 40 lbs to go. I'm late 50's.,7.0,49,liraglutide,7

I am 56 years old, have hypothyroid and pre-diabetic and my weight seemed to continuously increase over time. I am active but was having no success with any attempts to lose weight even when altering my eating habits. I started on Saxenda on March 15th and now just over 2 months I have lost 21 lbs. My weight was 183lb and my goal is around 155 or whatever feels right. I have focused to continue the healthy lifestyle with exercise and healthy eating. I also stopped drinking wine which was an adjustment for me but worth it with good results. The only side affect is I do feel tired. I have boosted by B12 and VitD, hopefully that will help. Oh and I increased my water intake in a big way - very important! Hope this helps!",10.0,46,liraglutide,8

BUT, insurance denied coverage for Saxenda so back to Dr. Second request for authorization and gave me another trial of Victoza. Insurance denied Saxenda again. I registered for the Saxenda prescription savings card and today went to my pharmacy $1021!!!! Talking to pharmacist he recommended getting script for Victroza bc insurance likes the price. Approved and my co pay is $25! I do get nausea when I increase dose, it doesn't last. Dry mouth bad first few weeks but helped me be motivated drink water. Diarrhea, yes rotating with constipation. Food doesn't appeal to me. Often don't eat dinner or just a few bites. LOT of fatigue. Heartburn mild but I think its bc I forget to eat and my stomach is empty.

I have not weighed myself yet and have no intention to do so. I am feeling less hungry though, or not hungry at all. But when I eat, I can still eat my dinner quite easily but I’ve noticed I am slower at eating and don’t quite finish the plate of my usual pre-Saxenda portion size. I am now 51 years old and have been perimenopausal since 44 years old, and have been on antidepressant meds for over 15 years, and the weight has just been creeping up and up. Having been overweight by 2 stones most of my adult life, that has crept up to 4 stones without increasing what I eat or when and dieting on and off constantly, so I’ve turned to Saxenda as I can only seem to manage to lose and regain the same 7 pounds for the last two years.

I stopped for about a week and decided to try again. This is now day 3 and I’m actually tolerating it better. I have not drank any alcohol and last time I had alcohol the same day I started my injection. Very bad idea... I now also take pepto or an anti nausea med right before I do my injection and I take it at bedtime. This has helped tremendously!!! I still have some belching and a slight headache but nothing like before. I’m really excited that my body is tolerating it.

598,Diane...,,"January 25, 2017",Saxenda (liraglutide),I started a workout program in February 2016 and was doing well by losing 50 lbs over 8 months. Like most of us though I wanted more. I took Saxenda for 6 weeks starting November 1 2016 and lost 14 lbs in the first few weeks. Appetite was really suppressed and the last 2 weeks I was extremely tired. I spoke to my Dr about cycling on and off as I noticed the weight loss had stopped once I hit 14 lbs. I went off Saxenda for 3 weeks and began again at the beginning of January and am down an additional 15 lbs. I will continue for another week and then cycle off for 3 weeks again and start over. I find the appetite and energy side effect kicks in around 4 weeks so by cycling on and off I can avoid those effects and maximize the weightloss,9.0,62,liraglutide,9

I’m happy to say, I’ve lost 6.2lbs in one week! The first 3 injections made me feel a little queasy, but I wasn’t too sick. I felt like I needed to rest up. The effects were immediate and it has just turned off cravings and snacking. I just don’t want any rubbish food anymore. It’s quite amazing really.

I have been overweight and you dieting all my life. I was recently been diagnosed with PCOS. Losing weight has been very hard, I track my steps and calories, I have been reducing the size of my meals. I had half a tuna sandwich and had to stop eating. The drug works on suppressing appetite, but the side effects are also very high for me. I have had diarrhea, constipation, lack of energy, headaches, feeling sick, and vomiting. I have dry mouth and am taking hyralyte to compensate for the lack of fluids I can keep in my system. I am in two minds about this drug, I don't know if I am going to continue it after I finish the 5 pens in my first box.

A few things from my experience: - If your current dose is working, wait to increase until you feel it less effective. When I tried going up faster, the side effects were worse. I am actually still at 2.4 and it is working great. Since I am paying for this out of pocket, I am thankful I can extend the use. - I would say my side effects have been manageable. However, they are disruptive to my life. I always feel like I have a lump in the back of my throat, like I might get sick, and my stomach always has a mild icky feeling...its ALL the time. - Anything with onion or garlic gives me heartburn.... and they never use to - Don’t over eat, you will pay for it!!

Well I was experiencing stomach pains which end up getting so bad I had to go to emergency. I had gallstones and mild liver damage. Jaundice the whole 9 yards. Caused by saxenda. These were one of the RARE side effects and I was one of the lucky people to experience it. I spent a total of 10 days in the hospital. The end of September and the month of October was rough for me. My liver enzymes were off the charts. I am ok now, gallbladder removed and liver enzymes are back to normal. So I'm letting you guys know this so that you are aware. Have your doctor check your liver enzymes and make sure you're good. I hate to have to leave it alone because it worked well but I need my liver.

I began working out 5 times a week and was losing weight but only a very small amount and I was hitting a wall. Once I began using Victoza and continuing my workout routine the weight just started shedding right off. This was everything I always dreamed of. You will lose some weight just by taking this but if you include it with working out wow! Also it does curve your appetite but I have noticed you can eat healthier things without feeling ill. It seems that high sugar and fats are the ones that I get turned off too which is just an added bonus. 1 month into it and I am now 186lbs so I have lost 20 pounds and feel and look great!,10.0,90,liraglutide,9

So on the Saxenda I feel much less hungry or interested in food at all and doses 0.6 and 1.2 worked wonders. But I am at dose 1.8 and my stomach is really bad me. I have a lazy digestion so I feel like the medicine is aggravating my stomach cramps and causing added constipation. But the worst is when I have on occasion eaten more then normally I have or around 1700cals I get so nauseous and have severe vomiting. If I stay under 1200 cals I feel fine but I feel I need to stay aware that I am eating at all. Need to drink way much water and if I do'nt get my protein I feel dizzy and exhausted.

Have made no effort to change diet, have taken no extra exercise. The problem is Saxenda has become less effective the longer I have taken it. At first, a big reduction in appetite coupled with dehydration at night and poor sleep. A week in, those symptoms disappeared. Just occasional mild nausea which soon resolved itself. So, side effects wise, Saxenda has been fine. In the first 3 weeks I lost 3 kilos. In the following 10 weeks about 1 kilo. My lifelong desire for second helpings crept back. 2 weeks ago I had a 2 week break from the drug because my supplier went bust. Back on it now for 3 days, it is suppressing appetite again, much better than recently. Mild nausea and poor sleep are back too however.

I could only barely tolerate the 1.2mg dose. I increased my water intake to 80-100oz, and if I ate more than 600-800 cal during the day I’d feel like throwing up. I had to stay on a liquid diet of smoothies and protein shakes, as solid food increased the nausea and bloating. I added a probiotic per my dr, but no help. I tried taking the injection at night to decrease the side effects, it only made sleeping more difficult as I was up during the night with headache and diarrhea. I experienced extreme lack of energy and shortness of breath in doing simple tasks (such as taking out garbage). My dr and I decided to stop due to the side effects.

I did feel slightly nauseous for a few days when I would increase my dosage. I do not feel hungry between meals and rarely snack anymore. When I do eat, I am full after a smaller portion. If I eat very greasy or high fat foods, my stomach will hurt, so it is a good deterrent! I have been extremely pleased with my weight loss and progress on Saxenda.

Initially the nausea and fatigue made me wonder if it was all worth it but after losing 7 pounds the first week I decided to stick it out. The best part, I have zero sugar cravings. My first month I drank vegan smoothies and small amounts of veggies and grains because that was all I could tolerate. I lost 30 pounds in three months. Every week when I would increase the dose per directions I would have three to four days of horrid nausea and fatigue. I had to force myself to eat or drink anything. About 3 weeks into the treatment I started burping like a frat boy beer bonging. They stunk too. Painful and embarrassing. Stool softener will address the constipation but be careful that can turn to the opposite on a dime. I also added a probiotic to help with regulating. Now that its been about a month or so on the full dose I am getting used to it and I am functioning near normal. Bottom line: This drug in like gastric surgery in a needle.",8.0,38,liraglutide,11

After the first two (2) weeks of injections and NO SIDE AFFECTS, I return to the doctor for a follow-up appointment to find that I had lost 14.5 pounds. Try it for yourself",10.0,40,liraglutide,15

I started off at 198 lbs and am now at 186 lbs. 12 lbs in 3 weeks isn’t bad. Exercising about 2-3 times a week. But stay physically active at work all day. Eating pretty much the same stuff, when I do eat. Suppresses my appetite so much that I have to remind myself to eat sometimes. I had 1 night of vomiting about a week ago. But other then that, no real side affects. I do have a little diarrhea here and there. I see it as a good thing though, cleaning out the bad stuff. Pretty pleased overall. My insurance covers all but $20 of the script, so that is good too. Will continue to update. Hope to lose at least 26-31 more lbs.",8.0,30,liraglutide,15

No side effects at all since starting medication. This medication works great as long as you exercise each day and learn how to eat and what not to eat. If you think you are going to eat bad things and still lose weight you are only kidding yourself. Things to stay away from are of course anything with flour or sugar, no bread at all, no red meat,and definitely no soda or alcohol. You need to learn how to eat while on the medication because you will need this knowledge when you get off of it. Make water with lemon slices your new friend!",10.0,44,liraglutide,15

I see this drug and my new approach to eating and fitness as a life changing event so I’m happy being patent for some obvious body changes. No one but my spouse has noticed any difference. The drug is easy to take and after the initial fear of giving myself a shot it has been quite easy. The best part of this drug is that all the crazy cravings have stopped. Before Saxenda I could eat a ½ gallon of ice cream or ½ a pie in one sitting but I haven’t had the slightest desire to even take a bite since I’m on the drug. It’s been remarkable.

I focus on fresh (no sugar, low carbs) and keep the fiber and water intake high so I’ve remained regular. I've noted that I 'pay' for eating too much at a meal with a stomach ache, since stomach emptying is slowed. I've also noticed a slight increase in systolic BP (still ok). The last issue is that I actually lost interest in food completely a couple of weeks ago. I had to purposefully go shopping to find 'yummy foods', and managed to re-kindle my interest. Net is that this is a good med, but you need to listen to your body while you're taking it, and write everything down that you're putting in your mouth while you're on it.

At that time, I went and bought OTC anti acid and began taking that in the morning with my other medications. That has seemed to help tremendously. I still burp and have indigestion but not as bad as before. I have not experienced any of the negative side effects that people have mentioned in previous comments.

I have a lot of nausea and have had two spells of gastric gas (like rotten eggs) and violent vomiting. What I have learned so far is that I feel better taking the drug in the evening (apparently the maximum effect of the drug is 11 hours after the injection) and to stay away from sodas or sparkling water.

Within 15 minutes I felt like there was a rush of blood to my head, spinning, so called Fire Rescue and was off to the ER. I have cardiac issues. I told them I missed two doses. They never looked into it. Gave fluids. Thought: carbon dioxide poisoning from the apnea exhaust. Not realizing it was the Saxenda, took another full dose 3. This time, I refused to go to the ER, I was vomiting profusely. This was caused by the Saxenda. Missing 2 doses meant I had to start over from .6.

Very mild side effects on my first week, until I switched the administration time from morning to bed time. No more nausea. Constipation is still a problem for me, still working hard to manage this. Injection site also has become a little challenging, but because it’s summer I don’t want to use my arms or legs, so I stick with my tummy area which has become very itchy and lumpy. My fitness pal app also helps with watching my cals, I am not exceeding 1000/ day. It works for me and my life is getting better every day.",10.0,24,liraglutide,22

I have needed to stop my dosage just so I can get back to work but plan on going back on the lowest dosage tomorrow. I am hoping I can stay on this lowest dose and still loose weight.

Initially I took the injection at night starting with .6 and gradually increasing to 1.8 to minimize nausea. I was extremely nauseated and was given Ondasetron by my endo for the first few weeks which REALLY helped.

This medicine really did cut my appetite a lot, so eating less is not that big of a problem now. I'm also not exercising at all. When I moved to 2.4mg, I did feel A LOT of nausea.

Eventually you will reach your goal and because it has been slow and steady those new eating habits will stay with you and you have a much better chance of maintaining your goal weight. Good luck everyone!",10.0,29,liraglutide,24

I’m not eating anywhere near what I was and seem to be constipated most of the time so don’t understand why the weight loss isn’t more. Haven’t felt 100% since being on the med but just very uncomfortable with nausea, bloating, and churning tummy most of the time. Burping is also strong and very unpleasant odour along with flatulence. I have 1 more increase to take but seeing next to no results is very disheartening.

I was suicidal and thought I had illnesses that could kill me. It was also causing me to be paranoid, and the anxiety was like nothing I'd ever experienced before. I was having palpitations and panic attacks too. I have to be honest, it only helped reduce my appetite a little bit, but I was eating less. This medication made me so ill with anxiety that every muscle in my body ached, and my muscles were extremely tired. I was really, really fatigued like nothing I've ever felt in my life. But after a week of feeling extremely suicidal and experiencing extreme anxiety, I had to stop this medication. Within 24-48 hours, I was back to myself again.

(Thanks to all who share stories here and to site host drugs.com). Prescribed product for weight loss following obese diagnosis by Dr. after trying diet and exercise alone unsuccessfully. First 3 days were as described by user many - nausea, headache, constipation and irregular sleep. Experienced gradual improvement each successive day after that period and now on day 11 with diminishing side effects. Have lost 12 pounds thus far on the journey to lose 75. So far it works for me. Definitely curbs appetite and supports eating less. Using a fiber supplement to help with constipation and it seems to work. Will post again in 14 days with an update.",,22,liraglutide,26

Also stomach pains headache and weakness from overeating; learned to only do that a few times. These painful memories keep me overeating now. It does seem like my progress has slowed down, been stuck at a lose of 40lbs for about a month. Definitely exercise, drink water and track what you eat; it will keep you focused.

I do weight training but no cardio. My BMI hit 27 and I felt so miserable. Uk private prescription service cost £55. The first day I accidentally overdosed as I didn’t feel the injection so assumed I had messed up, and did another one. Big mistake - felt rough and threw up. Since then, I have stuck to the 0.6mg, at the rate I am dropping I won’t increase the dose. Slight headache but the weather is hot ATM and I should drink more water. Starting to fit into my clothes and my confidence is back, next goal is to start running again. Once I regain enough fitness to sustain a good pace/distance I plan to come off Saxenda. I won’t rule out a short cycle on it in future, for me it has kickstarted my weight loss when all else has failed.

Went back down to 1.8 but never felt right again. 28 lbs lost in 34 weeks. Average weight loss .8 lbs per week. Pros: It helped control cravings and made me feel less hungry. Cons: The side effects. Not bad until I went past 1.8 mg. Then it was unbearable. I also found it inconvenient to take. I don’t hate needles, but it was a process. Also expensive.

I just upped my dosage from 0.6 to 1.2mg and I can honestly say I've only had one day of NOT feeling nauseous and extremely tired with an ever-present vile metallic taste in my mouth. It's been very difficult to function so I would think twice before trying this drug if you have a demanding lifestyle. I've stuck to a fairly healthy diet - calorie controlled, fairly low fat with a wide range of foods but small portions and no eating after 7pm and LOTS of water. Weight loss has been slow but acceptable and I am going to stick to as low a dose as possible as I am convinced my tiredness and nausea can only get worse on the higher doses. You really have to try hard to re-educate yourself how to eat on any diet and this medication is no exception so pooping after over-eating, as one user has reported, doesn't surprise me.",5.0,17,liraglutide,27

I was once 220 lbs and looked decent. With this drug, it will be a breeze. Also, I walk about 8 km a day and I barely eat. Sugar cravings are gone finally and need to pump out all the crap out of my liver until it functions back a 100%, then the weight will melt off. Happier than I can explain...to all you who are feeling discouraged, be patient.",10.0,19,liraglutide,31

During the first week of taking Saxenda, I felt like I was going to die. I had extreme nausea, diarrhea and fatigue. I had absolutely zero energy and had to take off from work for the week! But after the first two weeks the symptoms subsided. Currently, I am eating around 1,000 - 1,200 cal a day. I have zero appetite and zero cravings (which is new for me). I am down 25 pounds in two months.

I've been increasing my doses slowly because the GI side effects have been very uncomfortable. I've been having some issues with nausea, indigestion, headaches, and even chills a couple of days. This started when I increased my dose to 1.8. The drug works great for the appetite suppressant effect but I may stop taking it due to the awful GI side effects.

I have been on Victoza for about a month and lost eight pounds. I admit much of that is because I have no appetite. That makes it easy for me to make healthy choices when I do eat. One thing that I have noticed is that Victoza definitely slows down the bowels. I think it's imperative to up the liquid intake. Because of the bowels I think it's difficult to really gauge the weight loss. I go down a pound and up two the next day etc. I think taking measurements or trying on an old pair of jeans is more accurate in seeing the real weight loss.

I stayed on it until June and lost another 10 pounds. When I discontinued use, I began intermittent fasting, lost another five lbs but slower. Intermittent fasting is ideal to KEEP THE WEIGHT OFF. I’m going BACK on Victoza to lose the last 30 pounds but the key is to listen to your body when you get off Victoza. People who gained weight back starts eating wrong things.

I have slight nausea and a little diarrhea but that could be because I had my gallbladder out. The most side effect I have had is heartburn. Rolaids work good for it though. The only thing I've really noticed is at the beginning I was hungry all the time!!!!! I have a very slow metabolism so I'm thinking it was finally working again. I've lost 5 lbs so far. The injection site burns a little when first injected but that goes away within minutes. I'm not snacking like I did and not eating as much.

1379,Jschwab,Taken for less than 1 month,"January 19, 2017",Saxenda (liraglutide),I have been on Saxenda for 3 weeks now. The first week I experienced very little side effects which was relieving as I usually get very sick from medications. By the end of week one the smallest portions would fill me up which is wonderful but I had no weight loss and I was eating strictly healthy. Week 2 I stuck to .06 for an extra week so my body could adjust better and finished the week with 3 lbs lost since start date. Almost no desire to ever eat. Week three I have increased my dosage and have been feeling extremely nauseous and having weird chest pains. I hope it goes away. I'm a little uncomfortable with the possible long term side effects and will only stick this out if I start seeing results. Happy with appetite decrease though.,6.0,14,liraglutide,40

I find that Saxenda does curb my appetite and I'm not eating as much or craving the junk food the same. I only weigh myself every 3 months - not getting hung up on the scale numbers.

Which lasted THREE days. On my dr.'s recommendation, I dropped down to the next threshold. Two days of break from the med & the diarrhea (with the aid of a LOT anti-diarrheal meds) eased a bit. Upon restarting the med (two nights), it came back with a vengeance--worse than ever. Plus, terrible fatigue that caused me to take TWO days off of work (and I couldn't be away from the bathroom). Sulfur burps very bad, too. I cannot tell you the regrets I had for taking this med that I had so much hope for.

I purchased the medicine went to see my doctor told her I paid for it and she gave me five additional pens. My goal is to get down to 150lb, I'm hoping that the nausea will go away.

The sugar cravings will return, and while I haven't gained at any point, my best losses have been when I limit chocolate to a small piece twice a day (think one mini chocolate Easter egg two times a day), and kept carbs as low as possible - and ditched bread completely.

My advice is to make sure that you keep yourself well fed with several small portions a day, see nutritionist, and follow the docs orders. The first two days I dealt with extreme waves of nausea that lasts about an hour each time. I realized that I wouldn't lose weight, gain weight or have nasty side effects if I didn't keep myself full. I had several health issues occuring that required me to be on steroids, so I didn't lose as much weight as I could have lost. I will keep working hard and start exercising. I hit a plateau at 20 lbs lost but it is picking up again. Work thru the effects with your provider and do not give up! Diet/exercise never worked for me before and here I am!

Those with a craving to eat all the time - just don't do it. This drug slows your digestive system down and if you don't drink enough water and fibre you will end up with really bad stomach pains. I ended up going to the ER I couldn't poop and had bad stomach pain. I ended up having a diverticulitis flare up. I am still taking it but I am increasing my water and fiber majorly.

In one 24 hour period it was so bad I had nothing to eat. In addition, over the last two weeks since increasing to 2.4, unbelievable constipation occurred. The most bizarre thing is that over these last two weeks when I’ve barely eaten enough to keep a bird alive I have not lost a single ounce, not one!! It makes no sense. After the misery of several days at 2.4 I backed off to 1.8 but still was horribly nauseated. I’m now trying again at 1.2.

In November I lost 12 pounds. December I lost 12 pounds. It came off slower after that and my dog became terminal and died.

I made a concerted effort to get off sugar and bread. What a difference! I would like to know if the Saxenda becomes less effective over time and what happens when you go off it?

So I went to Walmart and purchased some Ginger capsules (sold beside the regular gravol). What a huge difference taking Ginger everyday has made! I take one Ginger capsule with every meal and then again at bedtime. The ginger has completely taken away my nausea! Now I am confident that I will be able to continue with the Saxenda.

I have only had very minimal side effects. Started with a mild headache it wasn't too hard to deal with. I rarely ever felt sick to my stomach maybe only a few times during the course of this drug. It did lessen my hunger a little not a lot though. The entire time I have been on this drug I've had mostly mild to moderate headaches. I lost 2 lbs total and gained 1 lbs back.....ugh. I decided today 4/23/18 that it is no longer worth the headache and no weight loss at all. So I am discontinuing using this drug.

It's usually worse when my dosage goes up each week but subsides in a few days. I'm still able to exercise but don't do as much as I should. If I did, I'm sure I'd be down more. So far I'm happy with it. I've struggled with my weight for the past 10 years. I've tried many things and I'm confident this will get me to a healthy weight.",9.0,7,liraglutide,52

It has curbed my appetite 90% - I went on an all inclusive holiday and come back 4lb lighter!! Within 3 weeks, I’ve nearly lost a stone.

When I increased my dose to 2.4mg I started having heart palpitations. I went to my doctor asap. My resting heart rate was 116 bpm. I had to have an EKG. This was very scary for me because I had the same reaction while on Contrave. I took the 1.8 dose and instantly feel horrible. I was jittery and confused and having mini panic attacks (which I had ever had in my life). Not to mention I was having some chest pains. I decided right then that I was giving up on weight loss pills/injections. I had nasty withdrawals for about 5 days. The withdrawals were way worse than the side effects. I have been off Saxenda for two weeks now, and I honestly feel so much better. I encourage you to know that certain side effects of the drug can and will harm your body. Don't fight through them.

I have been drinking lots of electrolytes to prevent dehydration. I don't know why the symptoms seem to be getting worse or just won't go away.

I have terrible dry mouth and a bad taste in my mouth that won't go away. It seems to have gotten worse after getting to the maximum dosage. I find that I am not hungry and I am eating so much less. Can't understand why I'm not losing weight. I'm beginning to wonder if this is worth having the dry mouth and bad taste all the time. My early symptoms of headache and diarrhea went away after about 2 weeks. Next came constipation and burping. I do think I am more depressed than usual.

Though it does work by killing your appetite and pretty much turning you off from food. So I did lose 10 lbs in a week but mostly bc I wasn't eating. However, it is not worth the god awful side effects. The injection stings and left little bruises.

So I'm stuck on the .6 but go to the doc Tuesday so we'll see what he says.

I drink tons of water now and 6 small portions a day. Oatmeal breakfast, sandwich lunch, reasonable lunch plate of food supper and yogurt in between meals and fruit. Small bowl cereal at night sometimes. I was tired of throwing up and being constipated on this med. It still was painful as a stomach injection at times as well like it burned.

At that rate she said I would gain 20 pounds a year and would be 300 lbs by 50. She suspected Contrave would work because of my issues with carb and sugar cravings.

Only side affect was got a bit of a headache for the first two days, doubled my water consumption to approximately 4-5litres a day and no more headaches. Prior to Contrave I was addicted to all sweets, especially chocolate, drank sugary drinks, was a constant snacker and over eater. I do not crave these things anymore which feels amazing. Within a week I have more energy, feel better about myself and have gained the confidence to beat my food addictions. Week 2 starts tomorrow. My starting weight is 95kg with a BMI of 37.

It is a tool to help you lose weight, but you have to commit to a different lifestyle which includes some kind of exercise and dietary changes. When I first went on Contrave, I was a little nauseous and my appetite was greatly diminished. I lost a few pounds at first but it wasn't until I started moving that the weight came off. I started by just walking a few blocks and over 4 months built up to full workouts at the gym. I also ate better and less. I have now been on Contrave 1 1/2 years and I have lost a little more than 50 pounds. I went from 211 lbs to 158 lbs and I have kept it off. I worry that I might gain weight if I stop taking it, but with all of the changes I have made to live a healthy lifestyle, I shouldn't gain much. Nonetheless, I will stay on the medication as long as it is safe to do so. Contrave didn't make me lose weight.

I am pretty much eating whatever I want, but I feel full very quickly. I have not put any weight back on and it's likely because I finally have portion control. Here is my advice to any newbies beginning this med based on my experience: The first few days I felt incredibly nauseous. Don't try to eat your normal diet and typical portion sizes. Doing that will probably make you feel very sick! Eat very light meals and very small portions. Although you're supposed to increase the dose until eventually you're taking 4 pills a day, I never took that many.

I called my insurance company to find out whether it was covered or not. The Dr was unaware and thought it was only a cash pay med.

My doctor threatened to cut my medication if I didn't lose at least 10lbs at my next 3 month checkup. I started walking 4-7 miles a day. I also started drinking a lot of water. In 3 months I lost 70lbs. The circulation and color in my legs returned, I have more energy, fit in a plane seat and can tie my shoes, went from size 48 to a 36 waist line. After ramping up to 2 pills a day in the morning, (I never took the 2 pills in the evening as I misread the instructions) When I discovered my mistake, I decided to just keep taking the 2 pills a day because it worked. No weight loss program is going to work if you are not all in. I expected the drug to do all of the work when I first began -mistake. I would recommend it but you do have to work with it.

Any spare chance I got I was working out. Even for a few minutes in my bedroom every night.

Despite this, I gave it a go. Day 1 was all I could tolerate. I felt drunk, dizzy and nauseated. Walking down the hall, I fell into the wall, suddenly from a huge bout of dizziness. That was it for me. I don’t doubt you will lose weight, but I do doubt it’s good for you. People have reported constant nausea, hair loss, rapid heart beats, ear ringing, dizziness, BP increases, headaches, side effects after months of use and sudden bouts of anger/depression. Heart studies have not been fully done as well which should be noted. It depends how desperate you are to lose weight. All I have to say is research and calculate your own statistics.

The brain fog many speak of turned into severe headaches and nausea turned into violent bouts of vomiting. To a point that I thought I would have to be admitted to the hospital. Also, unaware this contains an opiate blocker naltrexone and the ingredient bupropion used to treat depression, the neurological effects were also quite concerning. I had spasms in my muscles and joints, like small surges of electric shock.

At the very beginning I had some lightheadedness and queasiness and that came back for a short time each time I ramped up the dose but I stuck with it and now don't have side effects. The only time I feel bad is when I overeat or eat very rich food and that is the meds way of telling me to cut it out. I do not obsess on food anymore and can ignore the doughnuts and other junk food in the breakroom at work. I am paying about $100/ mo out of pocket and it is well worth it!

I am now able to sustain days fasting on stock broth only and have started losing weight again at a fairly slow but steady rate. I am almost 50kg down. I have had no side effects and consider the cost at about $20 a week to be worthwhile.

I have never been this successful in my weight loss journey in my entire life of being overweight. I am still not exactly sure how it works but it works. The side effects were mild for me, at first a slight headache that went away after about a month, some constipation but I am sure its because I have decreased my food consumption so much.

Side effects: a bit of the shakes with each dose increase which went away after a few days, slight dry mouth, and constipation. All very minimal.

I lost 10 lbs in the first 2 weeks and haven’t lost even ounce since. I had the full feeling for about 3 weeks but then it went right back to normal. The ringing in both of my ears is so loud and it never stops. The headaches are daily and at times are worse than migraines. This drug is too expensive not to work! I was told by many that you don’t get the full effect of the drug until you've been on 16 weeks. Sorry I don’t believe it. I wouldn’t recommend it at all.

Lunch is usually around 12pm and I'll have a hot pocket and maybe an orange but I'm usually feeling full after I eat the hot pocket. I still don't get those afternoon hunger pangs.

I was at 216 lbs. and dropped down to 180, losing 41 lbs. Completely eliminates any craving for alcohol and thus the calories associated with drinking. My food cravings were gone and I had to remind myself to eat, as I would frequently forget to eat lunch. There is a downside- I have essential tremors in my hands, which were made worse on this drug. Also- the efficacy of the drug diminishes over time. Initially, I was not drinking at all but after 6 months, I started wanting alcohol again. Also, while I did not gain a lot, I did start to gain back some weight in the last 6 months. I went off the drug as my doctor was concerned about blood pressure. Once off Contrave, I gained 15 lbs in 10 weeks. I still rate it a 10 because I am overall much better off because of Contrave and the side effects were minimal.",10.0,6,bupropion-naltrexone,20

I was already taking wellbutrine for depression, so I just stopped taking it when I started with Contrave. Smooth sailing. The benefit of having bipolar in this situation is that the medication I take for that, Lamotrigine, is not only a mood stabilizer but an anti-seizure med. The bottom line: I haven't thought about smoking at all, haven't felt the need to drink and don't even think about it, and my mood and temperament is even keeled. This is great! I have found a med that tackles all of my problems, and it works! So I'm on week 2 now. After the 1st week, I lost 8 pounds in my gut. No change the 2nd week.

I have gained back 7 pounds. Every weight loss attempt is going to be different with each individual, but I shouldn’t have to continue taking a brain altering drug to keep the weight off.

And that was taking only the morning pill, there was absolutely no way I was going to add in the second pill when I was in that much pain.

In consultation with my family doctor, therapist and weight loss doctor, I started bupropion 100mg on March 1 and then on March 8, added approximately 12.5 mg of naltrexone (1/4 of 50 mg pill), to make the drug “Contrave”. This was given to me to aid in weight loss and also to aid in chronic anxiety/mild depression. Today is 3/15 and I have released 7.2 pounds so far and have a general sense of well being that I haven’t felt in awhile! When just on the wellbutrin alone, at first I had a ton more energy throughout the day and could focus more but had more anxiety when I initially started it, and realized I needed to cut out all caffeine. After cutting caffeine and adding nalxetrone, my anxiety has diminished and I haven’t had to take Xanax nor have I had irrational thoughts like I was having prior to going on these drugs.

I don't want to quit because I love losing the pounds. I don't know how long I can deal with constant sick. I also have high blood pressure, type II diabetes and high triglycerides.

I have never taken more than 2 tablets a day -- one in the morning and one in the evening. This level of medication seems to be working for me and I didn't want to encounter any further side effects.

I love a nice cold beer & perhaps indulge a little too much on weekends - but I now notice I don't really care if I have a beer or not. losing almost 6 pounds is now motivating me to start eating cleaner and get walking / start some exercise regimen. Side effects I sweat more & sleep is not that great(but I also have hyperdrosis & take adderall). Will post after week 4",9.0,27,bupropion-naltrexone,28

But so far I can tell that my stomach is flatter and my thighs are thinner. Also my wedding ring fits again!!! I have been walking 30min a day for the past 2 1/2 weeks and have been watching my diet (no carbs/sugar). I'm very excited and hopeful. I have gained close to 100lbs in the past 5 years due to anti depressants and mood stabilizers. So I'm really hoping to get off between 75-100lbs.

I also eat between 1500 to 1800 calories a day . I am not perfect by any means . Been on a couple vacations and did not do so well. But overall this medication has helped me in numerous ways. It helps my binge eating ( I hardly ever do it anymore). I get fuller faster . I have no desire to drink alcohol ! That from a guy who could drink a 12 pack every day . I also believe it has helped me be more motivated and wanting to exercise. I see a lot of you stop taking it very fast . Give it time . I had wild dreams the first month and about once a week I have insomnia. But is I still get 4 or 5 hours sleep. The rest of the nights I get my 8 hours. I also get down on myself a whole lot less. I credit that to the meds. It might not be for everyone but it has done wonders for me.,9.0,19,bupropion-naltrexone,28

I take the doses with a meal which helps prevent nausea. I also found eating a banana would help with nausea. It did make me tired which has mostly gone away. By week 5 I was feeling really good and started exercising. I've had some pretty disturbing dreams that I wake up from occasionally. It does cause some constipation but there are plenty of ways to deal with that. The only side effect that I have a hard time with is I get hot/sweaty with any type of moderate activity.

The only negatives have been constipation which I address with a stool softner. I also find that I don't consume as much alcohol which is not actually a downside unless you are trying to get drunk. Most of my office is now on this prescription and most have lost 5lbs per month. It isn't covered by our inurance but should be. Love it!",9.0,23,bupropion-naltrexone,29

I was told my IV sedation would be Versed and Fentanyl and would be given in a small amount. After the IV sedation was started, I felt absolutely no effect. I was given lots of local anesthetic in my eye so my surgery was bearable but, frankly, it DID HURT! Then it dawned on me, the naltrexone in Contrave decreased significantly the effects of the opioid analgesic Fentanyl. I'd forgotten that Fentanyl is an opioid. So all physicians should know this.",10.0,17,bupropion-naltrexone,33

This drug was recommended by my therapist due to being a compulsive eater and the mild antidepressant benefit. I was already on a low cal low carb meal plan and doing food journaling but wasn’t losing weight cause of the stress eating. The first week was a learning experience. The first and second day I learned that if you eat something fatty then you will get sick no matter what time you took the pills. Your body will reject fatty foods. I think that is why people suffered from headaches and nausea. I have not had a problem since I cut out those foods. If I ate too much or ate even though my brain said not too then I would feel like I was having a panic attack. I do have a very active job and I sometimes walk.

I did not have any weight loss surgeries. People ask me, “What did you eat? How did you do it? Tell me your secret!” So I will share with all of you my secret. People don’t set out to become fat. People don’t set out to take drugs. I don’t believe when I hear “ I just love food.” We use drugs/food/alcohol to cover up our pain. I think food is one of the most difficult “drugs” because we always have to eat. My secret is that you have to have therapy to find out what causes you to do self destructive behavior. I had it for three years and then something happened. I was no longer focused on food. So the weight started coming off. I don’t believe in fad diets so I ate what I wanted but smaller portions. The weight came off. Of course I had to have surgery to remove excess skin. I’m much happier both physically & mentally. So that’s my secret. I hope it helps",,16,bupropion-naltrexone,33

On the weekend have a cheat day, you deserve it! These reviews who say they have been taking contrave for a month and haven't lost a pound must realize.

I have complete control over my eating now. No longer have cravings for junk food and have no desire to snack. I've been eating around 1050 calories a day, any more I feel like I've over eaten. My eating habits have completely changed. No longer eating processed food. Only thing I have a desire to eat is lean protein, fruits, and vegetables.

I don%u2019t take meds very often, and I didn't like the idea of going on a recurring and long term pill. That being said, the first week on Contrave has been incredible. I will say I was food obsessed before. Thoughts of food ran through my head throughout the day, and the idea of eating was always there. I had no idea how much mental energy I had been spending pushing those thoughts aside. Now, with Contrave, my head is clear. I no longer sit at my desk and watch the clock, waiting until it%u2019s a reasonable time to eat, or force myself to push on another hour before ultimately giving in and getting a snack. When I do eat %u2013 and yes, I still very much enjoy the taste of food %u2013 I don%u2019t feel that same sense of urgency and elation I use to. Those feelings would often trigger binge eating.

Since being on Contrave, almost 1 month I have only lost an additional 5lbs, and I excercise just about every day 2x/day. With Contrave, you do not have that feeling of being on a diet pill, like phentermine. So that may be part of the reason why I'm questioning if it's working. I'm not a fan of taking medicine and to me, the Contrave tablets are large. Also, I feel the need to eat with Contrave. I don't really think it has curbed my appetite, like phentermine.

Both experiences were the same. Notable side effects I’ve experienced include severe vivid dreams/insomnia (waking up throughout the night, tossing/turning), and constipation. Constipation I can deal with but the dreams/insomnia I cannot. I’m exhausted throughout the work day and have no energy to exercise. I also do not notice any changes in food craving, food tastes, or weight. I’ve read many reviews that praise Contrave for their weight loss, but the same reviewers go into how they’ve also followed a diet and exercised. I can’t help but think Contrave is just a coincidence. If you haven’t experienced side effects I guess you’re the lucky one. I’ll go back to Weight Watchers- safe, drug-free and I’ve lost more weight following that program than has been reported by those on Contrave. And I’ll have my sleep back.",1.0,4,bupropion-naltrexone,52

Fatty foods made the nausea worse. The headaches gradually subsided as well. The restless sleep got worse. By mid second week, with only one pill in the morning and one in the evening, I had full blown insomnia. Only two to three restless hours of sleep each night at the most.

There’s still some willpower involved, but it makes it much easier to stop eating. It works especially well if I cut myself off after a pre-portioned meal and immediately distract myself by doing something else. I’ll completely forget about eating.

I'm not hungry and, aside from my headache, I am in a good mood If I can get past the headaches (which interestingly make me crave something sweet and cold, like ice cream) then I think this will be good.

Side affects usually taper off after a couple weeks. Be aware that Buproprion is a cousin of Meth and is also sold as Zyban.

I needed to take anti nausea/motion sickness meds the entire time to keep from vomiting and experiencing the dizziness. I also needed headache meds 24/7 to get through the day without debilitating headaches. The side effects were supposed to lessen but as the dosage went up they got worse. I can only attribute the minimal weight loss to the unrelenting nausea. I knew these were side effects when I started the meds BUT had I known they would be so severe I would never have tried it. This is a combo of an anti depressant and a medication used to treat heroin addiction. If you are sensitive to any meds that alter your hormones STAY AWAY!

Originally was looking for a quick fix but realistically when it comes to weight loss there isn’t one. I gained 70lbs in the last 4 years and finally realized how unhappy I was. 20 days in and I have lost 14lbs/6kg. I am strict on my diet, though to be honest haven’t done the recommended exercise. So I can only imagine how much I would have lost in that time. As for the oily orange stools, I haven’t had any uncontrollable accidents, you can see it in the toilet bowl but haven’t had any embarrassing moments as of yet, but I am keeping within the recommended daily allowance of fats.

I found out real quick what I could eat and what I could not eat. There were a few days spent on the toilet, but I learned to modify my eating. Xenical does not make you jittery or fill you up. It works in your stomach and gut. I went to my weight doctor yesterday, and in three months, I have lost 33 lbs without much effort at all!!!

I now eat healthy food because I know what the unhealthy food will look like as it comes out and I am disgusted that all of that unhealthy fat was going into my body, into my arteries, around my heart.

I was skeptical of a safe, limited side effects weight loss medicine but as I was over 100 kilos and had high blood pressure I wanted to get on top of the situation. Although reasonably expensive I can only recommend this as I've lost 20 kilos over 3 months, including abstaining from gluten and sugar (most of the time) and avoiding overly salted processed foods. Whenever you eat something that is a bit fatty (10 grams or more to 100 grams of fat) take one of these after and you can be comfortable 30%~ of that fat will not be adding to the places you don't want it to be.

If you aren't a calorie limit diet, you still eat whatever you want and you hardly move a muscle then this drug is NOT for you. This isn't a magic pill that will make you lose weight overnight without any effort, you have to make the effort to exercise a little, moderate your food proportion and set a calorie limit every day.

It blocks a certain amount of the fat you eat from being aborbed into your body and thus reduces your calorie/fat intake. It's not a miracle drug, if you eat a very high fat diet yes it may help a bit but it won't do ALL the work. Also, if you eat little/no fat anyway it can't help as it won't do anything for you. It can't block fat that isn't there. If like me you're on a long term diet it can really boost your success. I have gone from a bmi of 47 to 39 in 6 months.

I started out weighing 222 and now I am down to 215 and shrinking. IT WORKS!! I have tried so many weigh loss pills and this is the only one I have used that actually works. At first it worried me to see the oil substance in my stool but I quickly learned it was my body fat residue leaving my body. I feel great and I will continue using the product.

Use the product but get off your lazy butt and exercise and eat right and by doing so with this product you will achieve results.,10.0,84,orlistat,3

Here are my top tips: 1) Before you even take it, make sure you discuss with your gp to monitor your progress and health. 2) Have a low fat & calorie diet at least a week prior to taking it. You can then iron out any clinks e.g. I am prone to late night binges so I made sure I put some extra emotional support in place and stocked the cupboard with healthy low fat snacks. 3) Make sure you have got some low fat ingredients and recipes to hand. The following I have found super useful: Low calorie cooking spray Reduced fat hummus and cheese Pitta bread Crumpets with a tsp of peanut butter Fruit and veg Beans, pulses and legumes: make these your best friend. 4) Keep hydrated with water. 5) Take a multi-viatmin either first thing in the morning or eve.",8.0,48,orlistat,3

As it stops approx 30% of the fat you digest from being broken down, you can lose fat soluble vitamins. My pharmacist suggested using a multi vitamin an hour before my first meal or 2 hours after breakfest so xenical wouldn't stop the vitamins, though talk to someone before listening to this advice. If you eat anything is a high fat content you will probably poop your brains out. While visiting my dad, he made meat pies and I had burning diarrhea all night and the following morning.

The biggest side effects for me have been brain fog, and sleeplessness. I read an article that said they are testing the drug for use on other addictive behaviors as well. I have a lot of energy. Some people have reported mood swings, but I have always been moody so I cannot comment on this. Some days I forget to take my meds and I've been on the drug so long I do not find myself hungry or even thinking about food. The drug made food with sugar taste bad which means I rarely reach for anything sweet now or that is carb heavy.

However, being on antidepressants (citalopram/Celexa) for depression, I believe Qsymia caused me to have suicidal thoughts and actions. I discontinued the medicine in July 2019 because of these suicidal thoughts. I was prescribed a new antidepressant (fluoxetine/Prozac) which boosted my mood considerably for a few months afterward. I gained all weight lost back. In April 2020, I tried Qsymia one last time as my weight was back up. Still on fluoxetine, within 3 weeks, my depression worsened and the suicidal thoughts came back.

Weird right ?!? So, as a last chance option I chose Qsymia . At first I did't think it was going to work , in fact it took a little over a month for me to tell it was doing anything ! In the beginning I had a few tingly feet sensations but that went away after time and I did feel weak at first but found out it was due to low potassium so if you're feeling that way have that checked out . To date I have lost 27 pounds , which may seem slow to some but it is coming off !

I also made an effort to take more steps throughout the day, by parking farther from entrances, getting up and moving around more at my desk and by doing some light to medium chores around my home. The only side effects I had were random rapid heart rate, tingling hands and occasional nausea and diarrhea- particularly after a meal. I lost about 40lbs total in a year. However, I reached a plateau. I'd gain 4lbs and lose 4lbs. Eventually, my weight loss stalled for several months. Then, it crept up about 5 or 6lbs.

Not exactly the healthiest for a teenager. Experienced side effects for topamax mostly tingly feet and hands, diarrhea, and some headaches to begin. Side effects on phentermine were a lot worse, I had a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, dizziness, anemia, constipation, dry mouth, metallic taste, pusitile tinnitus, and fever. Not all of these happen everyday but they come and go. The metallic taste in my mouth is all the time unless you drink water. The only good thing is I weigh 185 pounds. I’m not sure how long it took me to lose all of it but I definitely lost 10 pounds the first 14 days on phentermine. I didn’t exercise at all except I go to school and do a little gym class.
